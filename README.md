# picar
Code for the picar project me and my team created at the first Glasgow Picademy

For this project you need:
* Raspberry Pi (Wi-Fi Dongle if it's not a 3)
* Exlorer HAT Pro
* 2 motors and wheels
* 4 male to female jumper cables
* Battery pack or USB power supply
* Parts to build the robot chassis and axels (we used straws, wooded skewers and the tin from a CamJam kit)
